# bash-hotload
Nodejs script that runs a bash command every time a change occurs in a file

I use it while learning any kind of scripting to avoid having to re-enter commands. There are other solutions out there, all have some learning curve or their own dependencies to install. I'm not interested.

## Run
1. Need ES6-compatible Node.js installed in system. No external deps/libs.
2. Fill `FILE` & `COMMAND` IN THE SCRIPT.
3. Run `node hotload.js`
4. Now you can focus on making changes & saving them and command gets run on your screen 2.
